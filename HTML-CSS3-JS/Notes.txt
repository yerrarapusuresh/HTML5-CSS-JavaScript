============= Section 2 ========================
HTML: Hyper Text Markup Lanugage, it is not programming Lanugage it is a markup Lanugage.

- inseted of <b> bold and <i> italic, we should use <strong> and <em> tags for symmantical purpose. 


****  create lists ****
    - we can create list two ways in HTML 
        * ordered list using <ol> tag. numbers will be generated for each item.
        * unordered list using <ul> tag.   bullets or points will be generated.
      
      eg. for shopping items.
      <p> ordred list shopping items today</p>
      <ol>
        <li> oil </li>
        <li> soaps </li>
      </ol>

      <p> unordred list shopping items today</p>
      <ul>
        <li> chicken </li>
        <li> tomotoes </li>
      </ul>


**** Embedded images in HTML page ****
    - we can embedded images with image tag <img/>
    - it is self closing tag
    - it contains following attributes
        > src: source location of image
        > alt: alternative text for search engines and disabled people
        > height and width: it will scale the image accordingly. 

**** Hyper Links using anchor tags ****
    - we can navigate to other pages or within pages using anchor tage <a></a>
    - it contains two attributes:
        >href: where it suppose to navigate. e.g href="www.google.com"
        >target: it is more or like where to open. like replace current, or open separte tab or window

    -e.g <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

**** Structure HTML page ****
    - the following tags give more symmantic meaning to html page. it does not impact visually
      > header; group or aggrigate the relevent tags under this tag and justifies for the header
      > nav; group or aggrigate the relevent tags under this tag and justifies for the navigation or menu
      > article; group or aggrigate the relevent tags under this tag and justifies for main content;
      > footer; providies the footer menu such as copyright, year and owner;
    - the major idea is search engine will know much about your page when page is structurallyy defined.
